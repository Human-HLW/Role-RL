a little bit more about the c one thousand someone said the c one thousand the go absolutely like this thing is incredible brand new."], [53856, "let's just talk about the specs here"], [53858, 'so it has'], [53860, 'six ac outlets here on the front which can each handle'], [53862, 'eighteen o zero watts of constant power draw'], [53864, "this one it says surge pad that one can surge for a short period up to two thousand four hundred watt like which which is absolutely insane it's insane guys so like this little guy can handle"], [53866, 'eighteen o zero plus temporary two thousand four hundred watts'], [53868, 'insane guys'], [53870, 'the inverter i used to power my entire bus off grid'], [53872, 'that thing can handle a max of two thousand four hundred watts'], [53874, "that's a lot of water look how little"], [53876, 'i mean'], [53878, "you guys aren't appreciating look how tiny"], [53880, "it's so tiny when we unboxed it for the first time, we were like, no way like this thing is so little and it's so powerful"], [53882, 'and oftentimes people will say, listen,'], [53884, 'even if it can run all that,'], [53886, "it's only got one thousand watt hours of battery capacity. it's gonna go dead if you power something big, right?"], [53888, "that's true unless you're sustaining it by plugging solar in at the same time,"], [53890, 'which is also an incredible feature can handle a new level of solar,'], [53892, "which i'm gonna tell you"], [53894, 'six hundred watts'], [53896, 'for this size is incredible. yeah,'], [53898, "this thing can handle six hundred watts so let's say you're running like a window unit"], [53900, "ac unit and it's plugged into this thing"], [53902, "and it's pulling usually they pull six eight hundred watts"], [53904, "that's gonna keep it running as long as you got solar plugged in most of the day"], [53906, 'so this little guy right here so'], [53908, 'big things happen like no joke we unbox this thing we plugged in solar cool awesome we actually used the four hundred watt panels loved it'], [53910, 'then we took it and we put it over here by our bus and we charged our bus up with it like it could handle it it was awesome yep'], [53912, "yep so we had sole extra solar coming in to the unit and then it was feeding my battery bank inside my bus so this thing has endless possibilities and i love the layout of the ac outlets here it's so cool"], [53914, 'specs you got two usb c ports two usb a ports a cool warm led light'], [53916, 'and bluetooth where you can kind of'], [53918, 'add monitor from your a p p this car socket plug here one hundred twenty watts d c power and yeah guys plus the expansion cool stuff'], [53921, "travel diva i was literally working it's called the powerful because there's some renovations going on currently"], [53923, 'and i was powering my table saw all my tools which you can kind of see in one of our past posts but'], [53925, 'all those power tools this thing can handle no problem. yeah,'], [53927, 'love it'], [53928, 'absolutely love it okay, how much solar can it handle? six hundred watts coming in and if you want to charge it from an outlet under an hour.'], [53930, 'yep, which is awesome.'], [53932, 'which is awesome got the max solar put in right here.'], [53934, 'one'], [53936, 'point eight hours solar recharged'], [53938, 'boom.'], [53940, 'yeah, this thing is incredible okay,'], [53942, "if you have questions feel free to drop them in the comment anytime. then let's move on to the f twelve"], [53944, 'o zero'], [53946, 'f'], [53948, 'twelve'],

specs alright so it also has six ac outlets here"], [53958, 'this thing can handle a constant one thousand five hundred watts'], [53960, "and it has twelve hundred and twenty nine watt hours so that's the battery capacity that's the constant watts it can handle one hundred twenty car socket plug two usb c ports four usb a ports and a warm led light so that is this guy"], [53962, 'it can handle a constant three hundred watts so three of these one hundred watt solar panels hey just unfold those for us real quick there joel'], [53964, "and it looks a little now like compared to the two hundred watt we don't have the four hundred watts out here, but like now compared like it's so tiny. yeah."], [53966, 'so you just sit down like that,'], [53967, "flap her out. see, it's dirty. we use it all the time."], [53969, 'yeah. we legit use these products a lot.'], [53971, 'these little flaps here.'], [53973, 'there you go.'], [53975, 'and the sundial has to be one of the coolest things.'], [53977, "yep. so it's cloudy so you can't see it right now, but this little sundial allows you to get that perfect angle of the sun so you can max out and get the best watts coming in."], [53980, 'so yeah.'], [53982, "great question, scott. we'll get to it in one second."], [53983, 'last thing about this is right here behind it.'], [53985, 'boom.'], [53987, 'this is where you plug your portable powerhouse into within x t sixty cable or you can even plug in with a usb a or usb c cord and just charge your phone directly off of the solar panel.'], [53990, "yeah, it's pretty awesome. a lot of people will see a comment on our socials, on the anchor solar socials and say they don't look like they can take the wind very well."], [53992, "well, we were in emerald, texas all winter last winter and it's like the win capital of the us i think. and they did great."], [53994, 'if it was like sixty miles an hour, we would lay them down. but it was a pretty constant like twenty mile an hour win while we were there and they were fine. yep.'], [53996, 'so super easy stuff.'], [53998, "yeah, pretty cool stuff. alright, i'll just answer scott's question really quick and then we'll continue talking about the different powerhouses. he asked or they asked what would you get for power back up at home? like a full size fridge?"], [54000, 'full size fridge.'], [54002, "so i feel like there's a couple that fit but there are maybe ones i favor."], [54004, "so let's just kind of break that down and let me just kind of explain that in a few different layers here. first off, almost any powerhouse could power your fridge."], [54006, 'a refrigerator does not pull much. if you have a really big refrigerator, this one might not be able to handle the smallest one,'], [54008, 'but it could handle like apartment sized fridges'], [54010, 'like we have a large apartment size fridge and that would power it. yeah.'], [54013, 'now would it power very long? no, probably not.'], [54015, 'couple hours.'], [54017, "you can't like calculate how long it will power because a refrigerator doesn't constantly pull power."], [54019, 'it pulls until it reaches temperature inside'], [54021, 'and then it shuts off pulling power.'], [54023, "so you know, you can't do the math. you can know while it's pulling power how much it's gonna pull,"], [54025, 'but you cannot calculate how long it will keep you.'], [54027, 'so like the hotter it is in your house,'], [54029, "like let's say the power is out and it's summer in florida your house is gonna heat up pretty fast and your refrigerator running pretty hard so how hot is it?"], [54031, "how if you're using the fridge all that will change the timing but i we have a large apartment size fridge in our bus and this thing powered it for about twenty four hours this thing for like thirty six hours i think"], [54033, 'and then'], [54035, "so that's just an idea now if you have like even a hundred watts of solar or you have like a few hundred watts of solar coming in"], [54037, 'then you can sustain your fridge.'], [54039, "yeah, you'll be good you'll be good"], [54041, 'without solar though. yeah.'], [54043, 'two thousand four hundred watts for a large apartment size twenty four hours'], [54045, 'twenty four hours for a large apartment size fridge twenty four sorry'], [54047, 'thirty six thirty six hours for our for this is for our personal fridge we timed it'], [54049, "and that was when the weather was cooler it wasn't in the summer florida or anything it was like kind of seventy eighty degrees out"], [54051, 'so just giving you guys kind of like a'], [54053, "yeah so if you're only losing power for half a day"], [54055, "a lot of these will do you just fine if you need to sustain power for like a week or more than like thirty six hours or twenty four hours then you're probably gonna want solar plugged in as well running so you can sustain your fridge"], [54057, 'yeah.'], [54059, 'um,'], [54061, "so let me just give you a couple reasons why this one's my favorite"], [54063, 'i know a lot of people like to go camping or they have an rv as well'], [54065, "so not only is this one gonna be able like let's say you have power out cause of a storm during the winter or either thunderstorm in florida or hurricane or something like i grew up in florida"], [54067, 'hurricanes will knock your power out for a week or two'], [54069, "like easy if you're on the country yeah, if you're in the country like i grew up"], [54071, "this one's my favorite because not only like the battery capacity of being two thousand watt hours."], [54073, 'but look at this plug right here.'], [54075, 'you can just plug your r v'], [54077, 'right into that,'], [54079, 'that thirty amp plug,'], [54081, 'turn this button on,'], [54083, "you're good to go."], [54085, 'and so if you needed to leave an area,'], [54087, 'you wanted to go camping,'], [54089, 'you want'], [54091, 'to plug some of your household items in,'], [54092, "that's a great option."], [54094, 'this guy is going to be good for a lot of things.'], [54096, 'very versatile.'], [54098, "and if you're kind of following the weather, camping in the fall, camping in the winter, depends on how hot it is. you don't have to run ac."], [54100, 'this thing can sustain you guys. you can plug your whole r v into that and it can handle a constant one thousand watts of solar you can plug'], [54102, "into it and really sustain your r v while you're camping for as long as you want"], [54104, "as long as you're not running ac"], [54106, 'so yeah, super handy.'], [54108, 'yes. and someone mentioned the f three thousand eight'], [54110, 'hundred'], [54112, 'that one is a beast.'], [54114, "we don't have it this tall. it's so huge."], [54116, 'it weighs one hundred thirty pounds.'], [54118, 'yeah, i just started a poll. you guys feel free to let us know which powerhouse is your favorite.'], [54120, "so that's pretty fun. we have let's see. so we're at five forty five this live ends before it ends we'll be giving away see this little guy right here? right here. that little cutie."], [54122, "we will be giving one of those away to a lucky

kind of cpap do you have? maybe one's closest to your model."], [54148, "and then how long the different powerhouses will run them because maybe you want a couple hours in case the power goes out, maybe you want a couple days cause you're camping off grid."], [54151, 'so we do have a whole blog post dedicated to that to help you out for your specific situation.'], [54153, 'yeah,'], [54155,

app. this one can.'], [54164, "and actually, yeah, there's a lot you can control. so you can control,"], [54166, "i've used that mostly with this one because like i said, we've used this one. i mean, look at it. we've used this one a lot."], [54168, "and we will plug our bus directly into it and then we will control how much power we're giving our bus power or how much we're allowing,"], [54170, "how fast it's charging,"], [54172, "how fast it's charging. if you don't want to pull the like"], [54174, 'crazy watts that it does,'], [54176, "like i think it's fifteen o zero,"], [54178, 'then you can lower that amount.'], [54180, 'so'], [54182, "yeah, super handy. the app, this one, rachel, i don't think does, right? it does. this one does. you cannot connect to the app this new one of course you can super handy and then this one right up here does not connect"], [54184, 'okay interesting about the pole here most people really like the five hundred twenty one'], [54186, "yeah that's interesting i use it so yeah we use that one the most and then this one the two thousand the second amount like second whatever you want to call that okay so then what else what came in second was the c one thousand"], [54188, 'so the solex five hundred twenty one came in first and then the c one thousand yeah and then the f two thousand and what came in last was the f twelve o zero so interesting you guys'], [54190, 'i could see that.'], [54192, 'yeah, that makes sense. so yeah, back to the app how we will use it in our specific situation with our bus and being off grid.'], [54194, "so you can connect one thousand watts of solar. we're typically, you know, trying to add more solar power to our rigs. we just don't quite have enough in the summer."], [54196, 'so put out a thousand watts of solar here, plug it into this and we will limit how much power this unit is giving our bus so it can still kind of slowly be charging the unit throughout the day,'], [54198, 'but still be giving the extra power to our bus. so we have that extra a little bit of juice. so yeah, we love the app'], [54200, 'okay, look through some more of these questions that have come in.'], [54202, 'yeah, and just to clear up something she said right there,'], [54204, "you can't control obviously how much power is going out because that's going to depend on whatever is plugged in it's going to choose what's drawing"], [54206, 'but you can determine how fast the unit is charging via the app'], [54208, 'so'], [54210, "yeah, so when we plug my bus into it, i set that in my inverter app. that's how i determine how much i want the inverter to pull so"], [54212, "i think the app has both now but we'll double check. we'll double check and get back to that."], [54214, "alright, yeah, you guys have any questions and you're coming from facebook or instagram, go ahead and come over here to the website before we give away the five hundred twenty one right here."], [54216, "a lot of exciting stuff going on. we unfortunately just can't see your questions if you're not on the website live. get on over here. yes, so get on over here. we got a little time left. we would love to get to your questions."], [54218, "scott asked any info on the solar tax credit for that two thousand battery? i don't know off the top of my head"], [54220, "so i don't we didn't use any of that personally, but i'm sure that could be a little easy google search to figure that out if it qualifies for your area"], [54222, 'will the units take solar as priority? i feel like that question is really targeted towards the f three thousand eight'], [54224, "hundred more than than these we've just really used one or the other cause if you're using solar the cord to plug this into a wall is really short"], [54226, "and so it's gonna be kind of hard to do both"], [54228, "so so yeah if you are charging these by solar you cannot plug them into an ac outlet wall at the same time so if that's the question i think it is yeah"], [54230, 'yeah, absolutely great questions keep them coming guys i can really tell you guys are super knowledgeable in all this stuff and i have a lot of great questions so keep throwing them out there.'], [54232, 'here soon we will be doing the giveaway because that live is going to be coming to an end before you know it.'], [54234, 'and super excited for one of the lucky winners. love hearing that.'], [54236, "while we're waiting for some more great questions to come in, joel, will you show how easy it is to put out the two hundred watt solar panel? oh, yeah."], [54238, 'and just for reference, so five of those will get sat out and plug into the f two thousand,'], [54240, 'which is a total of obviously a thousand watts.'], [54242, "yeah, come closer here because i can't go much farther away from"], [54243, "yeah, i can't go much farther away from the wi fi"], [54244, "so these are the little flaps they magnetize you're gonna set it like this"], [54245, 'and then just like the other one'], [54247, 'this one kind of folds out a little differently'], [54249, 'it looks so little compared to the four hundred watts'], [54250, 'i know the four hundred watts are like this big.'], [54251, "they're massive."], [54253, 'yep, flip those down.'], [54255, 'can you turn to the side for us so we can see the flaps?'], [54257, 'super easy to set up guys. it really is'], [54258, 'boom.'], [54259, "i'll just set it up this way."], [54261, 'yeah, love it love it. it looks so tiny now'], [54263, 'boom boom'], [54265, 'and then'], [54267, 'beautiful.'], [54268, 'get the last one and then the solar panel plugs in right here.'], [54269, "yeah, there's a little port over there. if i walk over there, i think we might lose connection. yep, a lot of good questions about the panels and the solar banks. so these will come in with their own plug."], [54290, "you will just lay them out. the cords connect there, they connect to the hub and one hub connector goes right into here. so you don't have to worry about figuring out parallel or series or wiring."], [54292, "you just plug and play. all of anchor systems from the smallest to the largest are maybe plug and play system. so you don't have to think about all the little crazy details. so you literally just set them out plug them in and go"], [54296, "maybe connect the app so it's a little you know you can control it from your chair make it lazy style so these are like the cords you'll just pick those up from you really quick"], [54300, 'x t'], [54301, 'sixty'], [54302, 'yep,'], [54303, "these are the cords you're gonna plug into the solar panel so you'll you'll see right here you'll see right here just plug it right in"], [54304, "and then there's a hub that the other end plugs into and you just plug them all into the hub and then that gets plugged right back here there you go easy super easy we like to keep things easy to anchor no complicated stuff here"], [54305, 'yes super easy joyful dairy i love that name i might steal it'], [54306, 'going back to the questions'], [54307, "easy like sunday easier than sunday morning that's how easy it is"], [54308, 'okay some people talked about joining late'], [54309, "so we have not given away this little five hundred twenty one yet we will be giving it away here soon the live's gonna be going on for like fifteen more minutes we will be giving it away somewhere between now"], [54310, 'and fifteen minutes as long as that rained is'], [54311, "i'm thinking"], [54312, 'oh no'], [54313, "um yikes okay clouds are moving fast they are moving we're gonna keep an eye on them it may not rain on us it might just look bad and pass right over us so"], [54314, 'fingers crossed but we will be giving away the five twenty one right here. we also give one away every friday on tik tok live anchor solex tick tock tick talk'], [54315, 'tick talk'], [54316, "and we give one away just for being a part of the live. we want to say thank you and want you guys to have the chance to try out an anchor solex power station because they're really awesome. we've been using them"], [54317, "almost two years and we really love them. if you can't tell this guy right here we use a lot"], [54318, "also we didn't really talk about the handle."], [54319, 'oh yeah, yeah makes it easy to move around'], [54320, "isn't she beautiful?"], [54321, 'yeah'], [54322, 'lifts up'], [54323, "look at that she's a beast really is a beast i think they should have named it the f two thousand beast like it's a beast it really is i don't know the f three eight o o might take that like that cake because that thing's huge"], [54324, "oh no i know it's the wind is picking up you know we're fine we're fine it's gonna be fine"], [54325, 'oh my gosh'], [54326, 'can the c one thousand have have more than one expansion battery connected?'], [54327, "i think it can only do one to my knowledge it's just one now you want to talk about the f thirty eight hundred more than one"], [54328, "yeah, which is not out here. that's the big boy but"], [54329, 'a lot more than i would ever need'], [54330, 'for my bus.'], [54331, "yeah, it's huge. yeah. how much does a c one thousand weigh?"], [54332, "it's so cute. like seriously, i don't think on camera i don't think you guys can grasp like i have a pretty small hand and like it's so it's so tiny."], [54333, "yeah, i think it's like"], [54334, "i'd say close to thirty pounds."], [54335, 'yeah.'], [54336, "twenty five maybe it's it's amazing."], [54337, "that's my guess. i don't know the exact way."], [54338, "yeah, it's incredible stuff. so yeah, it's like we'll have to look that up around thirty thirty five pounds not too bad. so you can double the weight or maybe a little less if you're gonna be doing the expansion battery and again"], [54339, "the solar input on that one is just incredible but yeah how many curls can joel do with the c? one thousand alright, let's do it one two oh my gosh that stuff's blowing away i lost count"], [54340, 'two thousand'], [54341, 'two thousand wow great question how much'], [54342, 'how much does the f two thousand weigh?'], [54343, "that was i'm trying to

bottom one right here the one that they have penned on the screen if you want to read more about it you just tap that little icon on the screen if you're on our website"], [54347, "and that one is about sixty pounds and you can just about double the weight if you're going to put the expansion battery on top"], [54348, 'but you also double the capacity.'], [54349, 'yeah. so pretty good pretty good stuff. great questions.'], [54350, "let's see how much do you think i want to say it was forty five pounds is what the f one two o o weighed."], [54351, "oh no, that one's like thirty five."],
